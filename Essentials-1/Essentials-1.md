# Intro to programming

## Natural vs programming language
Natural language is a tool for expressing and recording human thoughts.

Programming languages are defined by a set of rigid rules, dictated by specific needs.

This rules include: lexicon, the group of symbols the language could use; syntax, the rules that determines the appropriate way of collating symbols; and semantics, the meaning of every statement expressed in the given language.

Programming languages are useful when communicating with computers. Computers (as well-trained dogs) responds only to a predetermined set of known commands. A complete set of well-known commands is called an instruction list (IL), and different computers could have different Ils.

The ILs forms the machine language. This is the most primary language to command a computer, and essentially computer programming is the act of commanding a computer. however, machine language is difficult to understand to humans and a program written for one computer may not work on another.

Programming languages work as a bridge between natural language and computer language. This language are often called high-level programming languages (it also depends on the level of abstraction).

From a programming language it is possible to tanslate the program to machine language, and this translation can be don by a computer. Since a translator can be wirtten for each computer, it is possilbe to write one program for multiple computers, this feature is called portability.


## Compilation

The process of translating from a programming language to machine code is called compilation, and a specialized computer program that translate is called a compiler.

The program written in a programming language is called the source code, and the file that contains it is called the source file.




# Basic data types, operations and flow control (decision statements)

# Flow control (loops), typecasting

# Switch, arrays, pointers and basics of strings

# Operations on arrays and pointers, memory management and functions
